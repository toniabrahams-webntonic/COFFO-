"""Views for core site features: reviews, contact messages and reservations.

This module contains three small views:

- submit_review: authenticated users can create or update a single
  review tied to their account. Uses messages to provide feedback.
- contact: accept a simple contact form via POST and save a Contact
  instance for later processing.
- reserve: present and process a ReservationForm to create a
  reservation record.
