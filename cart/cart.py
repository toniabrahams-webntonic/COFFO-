"""Simple shopping cart backed by the user's session.

The Cart class provides a small API to add/remove products and to
iterate over items stored in the current session. Products are stored
in the session by their ID along with quantity and price at the time
they were added. The cart does not rely on any database object being
persisted for the lifetime of the session; instead it looks up the
Product objects on iteration to attach fresh model instances for
display in templates.
