"""URL configuration for the cafe project.

This module declares the root URL patterns for the site and delegates
to application-specific URLconfs such as `blog`, `cart` and
`registration`. Static media files are served during development by
appending the result of ``static(...)`` when ``settings.DEBUG`` is
enabled.
